Goals of this project are to build a flexible yet accessible way to create templates and then generated complex
nested groups of tasks that can be completed etc.

### Scenario 1 - Employee Onboarding Checklist

- Job Offer Form (revisions of documents) (r)
  - Job Offer Acceptance Form Once this is approved the prior step is completed (r)
    - Employee Contract (pdf signed and scanned) (r)
      - Tax Form (pdf form scanned) (contract must be approved)  (r)
        - Bank Payroll Information (tax form must be approved) (r) (marks checklist complete!)
      - Emergency Contact Form (important once employee contract signed) (optional)
